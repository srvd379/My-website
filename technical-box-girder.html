              <p>In the history of DFCC, many projects have been completed till date and many are currently in progress. In the current scenario of Infrastructure boom, Bridge structures are becoming as one of the major components of these DFCC projects. Many of the latest technologies have been captured for successful completion of these projects/structures with reduced time and cost.
Here, we have described the construction methodology for one of the longest and most critical Bridges in DFCC history. Below are few specifics of the Longest Bridge:
Length of the Bridge – 2.76 KM (32m X 85 Spans + 19.8m X 2 Spans)
Average Height of Substructure/Pier – 25 m (approx.)
Construction Methodology – Pre-casting of Full Span Pre-Tensioned Box Girders of 32m length
Erection Methodology – with Full Span Launching Gantry
This Bridge is located at the Foot of Aravalli Hills in Gurgaon -Sohna region, which comes under the CTP-14 package (Rewari to Dadri) of WDFC projects.
In terms of Innovativeness, there are a lot of highlights in the complete process of Pre-casting & Erection methodology:
•	For Pre-casting of Box girders, Pre-tensioning Beds are designed to withstand a Pre-tensioning force of 3500 MT – First of its kind in DFC Railway Projects.
•	6 nos. of Pre-casting Beds are made to reduce the production time & cost of Box girders.
•	A production rate of 18 Box girders per month is planned, which corresponds to casting of nearly 576m of superstructure in a month. This can be a benchmark in DFC Projects.
•	The shifting of pre-cast Box girders are planned with Powered Shifting Trolleys in both transverse and longitudinal directions. This will eliminate the usage of high capacity gantry cranes and is an Innovative solution.
•	The Box Girders will be lifted with 2 nos. synchronized Gantry cranes from over the shifting trolley & will be handed over to Tyre Transporter at the feeding location. The Tyre transporter will transport the Box girders over the erected spans till the erection location. This is a unique solution and first of its kind in DFC projects.
•	The Erection of Box girders will be done with Full span Launching Gantry of capacity 360MT. The Launching Gantry can negotiate an alignment curvature of minimum 700m radius and a longitudinal slope up to 2%. It can also deliver an erection cycle time of 2 days per span, which will contribute in faster completion of project.
